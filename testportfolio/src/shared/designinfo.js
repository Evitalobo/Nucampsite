        process1_3:"Creating a measurement(like using a droplet icon translating to how many inches of water), making sure that stars for each stage have a different variation, account for different seasons such as winter requiring less water, different climates such as florida needing less water and california need more water and humidity come into play, understanding that based on the plant type, it will need different soil(ex:succulents need cactus soil or rocky soil where seeds need soft and nutrient rich soil), how to properly transfer plants once it is a seedling and how much to water it after, some plants require sun but get burned easily so how can that be prevented, how can optimize growing multiple things at once (peppers n tomatoes grow well near each other)",
        process1_4:"Divide each plant into different sections and allow the user to input whatever knowledge they have, gamification of inputting knowledge allows the user to collect points , social media component will allow people to have a space to talk, incentivize plant postings more than just comments/questions, rate pictures as higher point value",
        process2:" The “Narrative” IDEO method was also used for research on this Low-Fidelity analyses. I asked the test user to go through the various stages of the paper prototype and think out loud on his thought process. User first recognizes that the enrollment page displays enrollment dates and times right away. He then clicks on the “Add” button within the shopping cart section that takes him to the class search page. Here the user notices the addition of the Academic Advisement Report and the real time scheduler and then comments on how useful it is to have it placed there. He then searches for a class which updates the search window rather than going to a whole other page and recognizes the “update schedule” buttons on the bottom right of each class result. User then comments saying he assumes the update schedule button updates the calendar window to the right which is great feedback - telling us that it is designed intuitively enough. User then states that the school site really does need a visual representation of class schedule in order to see time conflicts easier. User then clicks on a class which takes him to the class details page noting that there are new features such as “Professor” contact and office hours, and the “class resources” which contains hyperlinks to syllabus, books, and other resources. User then clicks on “Add” which takes him to the section selection page commenting that it is nice how sections are displayed in calendar view as opposed to just the list of possible sections. He then clicks on next which takes him to the confirmation page which isn’t changed much. Finally he clicks “enroll” which takes him back to square one, the “Enrollment Page”. ",
        process3:"Scenario Testing was used when I tested our low-fidelity prototype. Like the previous time this method was used, the scenario for this test was finding a class to satisfy a GE requirement that was currently unsatisfied, only now the test was done with another user. I decided to use this method again, as it acted as both an applicable and relevant test for the user, but also allowed us to better compare how a user would run through the scenario with our prototype in comparison to the current MyUCSC website. Aside from explaining the basic scenario, I found myself not needing to explain anything more than that, as my user was able to quickly understand and navigate our prototype with relative ease. After running through our scenario, my user noted that the addition of seeing lecture and section times in calendar view at nearly all times, as well as seeing potential scheduling conflicts, made the enrollment process much easier. However, he also did note that one way our prototype could be improved is by including a way of going back, and seeing where multiple courses would fit on a calendar rather than just the one that was selected; this could help with schedule planning, as well as give users a way of having backup courses and schedules. The lack of an ability to go back a page in our prototype was an oversight on our part, but having the ability to look at where multiple courses fit on a calendar as my user described was something that never crossed my mind when we made our prototype, so this is definitely something worth taking into account when designing our high-fidelity prototype. ",
        process4:" For our last IDEO method, we used the “Fly on the Wall” method to test our paper prototype. We used this method because we wanted the user to go through our low fidelity prototype without interference. By doing this, we can see where our user gets confused or experience negative feelings. This method also gives us insight into the user’s mental process. When we first presented the paper prototype to our user, the user understood each button and process. The user started off by clicking “Enrollment” from MyUCSC. From there on, the user recognized the enrollment page and the information such as the enrollment date and units. After the user realized they could start adding classes, the user clicked on the “Add” button which led to the class search page. The user did not interact with the search page as much but he user mentioned how they like the “Academic Advisement Report” feature that pops up in the class search page. The user stated that they liked it because they wouldn’t have to switch between pages. After the user searched the class, they clicked “Update Schedule” that updated the real-time schedule. However, the user stated “when I click, update schedule, that would add the class.” This was not the intention of our interface, so this is something to consider when we design our high fidelity prototype. After the user entered the class detail page, the user did not read through the details. They just clicked “Add” and proceeded to the section time and confirmation page. There was nothing notable during the last part of the process; it went very smooth. Some things to consider for our redesign is to alter design when adding classes. “Update Schedule” should not indicate a class being added. We should also make the class detail page more obvious so the user would look it through. ",
        process5:"After evaluating our user test reports, these were the general changes we decided to implement across all of the webpages: A back button and Aesthetic (font and color scheme). In our low fidelity prototype, we forgot to add a back button. After several users pointed out the absence of that feature, we realized the importance of it and had to implement it. The purpose of the back button is to serve as a tool to refer back to information in previous pages as well as an error prevention tool for users who accidentally clicked forward. This is a very important feature that should not be overlooked. That is why we decided to include it in our high fidelity prototype. ",
        process6:"As for the aesthetic, we wanted to maintain a consistent font and color scheme. We wanted to change the color scheme because our low fidelity prototype was black and white. We wanted our high fidelity prototype to reflect the university’s color. We also picked a font to display professionalism. ",
        process7:"When comparing our low-fidelity prototype to our new high-fidelity one, not much needed to be added or improved upon from our first prototype. Not including the minor changes that come with translating a paper prototype to a digital format, many of the pages for our enrollment website got upgraded mostly in their aesthetic. This was done to maintain consistency across all of the pages we made, as well as give the website a new and refreshing look. However, that is not to say that no changes were made between prototypes. In comparison with the low-fidelity prototype, the placement of buttons such as the button to go back a page, or the button to add a class in the “Class Details” page, has been slightly adjusted. The button for going from the “Section Times” page to the final “Confirmation” page has been removed entirely. Since the section times are now shown in a calendar rather than a list, we found that simply clicking on the desired section was a simpler and more intuitive means of going to confirm the course and section. A more significant change was one that was added to the real-time calendar that appears when searching for classes. One tester of our low-fidelity prototype proposed the idea of allowing users to add multiple classes to the real-time calendar rather than just one, as that could help with planning out one’s schedule before committing to enrolling. We found a way to implement this by creating a set of tabs for separate schedule plans for the users to experiment with. This gives users the ability to look at multiple classes and schedules without cluttering the calendar.",
        process8:"After looking over all of our user test reports in depth, we decided to first implement the ability to select between different time zones when choosing an enrollment term. Users said it would be a nice addition incase a student happens to be away during an enrollment period or an international/transfer student. Next, we made the enrollment appointment dates and times appear at the very top of the page after confirming enrollment term and time zone so that it is very clear to the user if they can enroll for that term as opposed to the current portal where the student has to navigate to a completely different page just to see time a date. Under that section is the shopping cart which hasn't changed much except for a much nicer looking interface than the current portal’s. Under the shopping cart we have the student’s weekly schedule in calendar view by default rather than list view on the current portal’s page. After clicking “add” in the shopping cart section, the user is then taken to the newly improved class search page. ",
        process9: "This new class search page has the search field categories seen in the current page however, it is moved all the way to the left to make room for the two new sections featured in our paper prototype: the “Academic Advisement Report” and the “MyScheduler” real time calendar. The Academic Advisement Report is located on the top right of the page and is split into two smaller sections labeled “Incomplete Classes” & “Completed Classes” both with drop down menus listing “Major requirements” and “General education”. The “Major Requirements” drop down menu is specifically catered to that student’s major year curriculum. Major requirements change from year to year but do not change for the student once the student declares. This serves as a convenient guide for the student when they are not sure what to take. Under the Academic Advisement Report is the MyScheduler real time calendar that updates with class time information when the user clicks on the “update scheduler” button located in the class search results list. This is a useful tool as users can quickly test if a class works with their schedule based on classes that are already in the shopping cart or already enrolled in without having to go through the various steps. Currently students must either remember when their other classes were at or go through the entire process of searching a class, clicking add, enroll, chose section time, confirm, and then see if the portal has found a schedule conflict. The MyScheduler calendar also has the feature to add and create multiple schedules with different classes incase the student wants to experiment with schedules for that term. ",
        process10: "Next, we made an addition to the class details page displaying the class professor’s email incase the student wants to ask questions regarding the class before enrolling in it or to get a permission code if the enrollment is barred to certain students. There is also another addition where the “Class Resources” section has a link to the class syllabus incase a student wants to see the weekly plan and overall rigor for the class. ",
        process11:" Lastly, we made a change in the section selection page where it is displayed in calendar view rather than list view to visually represent which section times work best with the student. This is done similarly to the MyScheduler by displaying currently enrolled classes under the available sections and highlighting the conflicting sections red and highlighting the suitable sections green. The confirmation page stayed relatively the same to the current one as not much was wrong with it. ",

        summary:"After the redesign- users were able to complete scenario testing prompts for finding enrollment time and signing up for classes up to 5x faster than the old layout. All of the users(12) said they preferred the redesign compared to the old design. New Features that worked really well were showing visually your schedule before you sign up for it, the course details page, use of icons(add, search and home) and overall information hierarchy. Features that didn’t work is that the overall aesthetic could have been slightly better in regards to giving components more space for margins and padding. ",

For the second page (Class search with all search field categories and Academic Advising Report) the user wanted to have the new SOE labeling system implemented for the classes under the Academic Advising Report and Class Search.

Currently students must either remember when their other classes were at or go through the entire process of searching a class, clicking add, enroll, chose section time, confirm, and then see if the portal has found a schedule conflict. The MyScheduler calendar also has the feature to add and create multiple schedules with different classes incase the student wants to experiment with schedules for that term. ",
        process10: "Next, we made an addition to the class details page displaying the class professor’s email incase the student wants to ask questions regarding the class before enrolling in it or to get a permission code if the enrollment is barred to certain students. There is also another addition where the “Class Resources” section has a link to the class syllabus incase a student wants to see the weekly plan and overall rigor for the class. ",
        process11:" Lastly, we made a change in the section selection page where it is displayed in calendar view rather than list view to visually represent which section times work best with the student. This is done similarly to the MyScheduler by displaying currently enrolled classes under the available sections and highlighting the conflicting sections red and highlighting the suitable sections green. The confirmation page stayed relatively the same to the current one as not much was wrong with it. ",
        bullet1_1:"MyScheduler tool was hard to locate (4 menu navigation errors)",
        bullet2_1:" Users had to switch between multiple tabs to look for the information needed",
        bullet3_1:"Materials were hyperlinked under the Class Search page but it only led to the Bay Tree Bookstore- not the product",
        bullet4_1:"Could not find other materials such as the syllabus, MSI schedule, or class website",
        bullet5_1:"There are too many words and the layout makes it hard for visual learners",
        bullet6_1:"Students can’t see their schedules while signing up for other classes ",
        bullet7_1:"Students are shown the schedule before they even know their enrollment date",
        bullet8_1:"Students can’t see their schedules while signing up for other classes",
        bullet9_1:"The aesthetic of the website seems very drab and generic",
        bullet1_2:"Less words and more visual information for easy navigation on the first enrollment page overall",
        bullet2_2:" Enrollment times and dates to the first enrollment page and as well as a weekly schedule based on the classes you’ve enrolled in",
        bullet3_2:"A small Academic Advising Report that would be divided based on completed and incomplete requirements for graduation and your major(s)/minor(s) on the class search page",
        bullet4_2:"Larger “Add” buttons to the enrollment first page, “search” class and class details page",
        bullet5_2:"A MyScheduler would be used to see if there are time conflicts while trying to add classes and it would be on the class search page",
        bullet6_2:"After the class details page, there would be a scheduler telling you which section times work with your schedule, which are open and which are closed ",
        bullet7_2:"A class resources section will include a link to the syllabus, a link to the books or any other necessary material for the class",
        bullet8_2:"The class confirmation page would also include a class preferences section that will include a waitlist if full, permission number, grading options and a swap class feature",
        bullet9_2:"A professor’s category would also be under the class details page so you can see the professor’s office hours, website and contact",
        summary:"After the redesign- users were able to complete scenario testing prompts for finding enrollment time and signing up for classes up to 5x faster than the old layout. All of the users(12) said they preferred the redesign compared to the old design. New Features that worked really well were showing visually your schedule before you sign up for it, the course details page, use of icons(add, search and home) and overall information hierarchy. Features that didn’t work is that the overall aesthetic could have been slightly better in regards to giving components more space for margins and padding. ",
